- 👋 Hello, I'm @BuzzPopGames
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and hopefully coding goofy little games
- 🌱 I’m trying to learn a 3d engine that would work on my potato computer and 3d model things.
- 💞️ I would like to do the programing independently but don't mind criticism or advice
- 📫 How to reach me ... Just email me at yourlocalbuzzkll@gmail.com, but be appropriate please
